# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Clinic ERP System is a comprehensive web application designed to manage clinic operations including user management, patient records, appointments, and prescriptions. The system supports multi-tenant architecture where each clinic operates independently with their own staff and data. The system provides role-based access control with three distinct user roles: Clinic Admin, Doctor, and Receptionist, each with specific permissions and dashboard views.
