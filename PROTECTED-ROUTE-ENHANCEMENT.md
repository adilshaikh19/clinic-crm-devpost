# ProtectedRoute Component Enhancement

## Overview
The `ProtectedRoute` component has been enhanced to support multi-role access control, allowing routes to be accessible to multiple user roles simultaneously while maintaining backward compatibility with single-role routes.

## Changes Made

### Enhanced Role Checking Logic
**File**: `frontend/src/components/shared/ProtectedRoute.js`

**Previous Implementation**:
```javascript
if (requiredRole && user?.role !== requiredRole) {
  return <Navigate to="/unauthorized" replace />;
}
```

**New Implementation**:
```javascript
// Handle both single role string and array of roles
if (requiredRole) {
  const allowedRoles = Array.isArray(requiredRole) ? requiredRole : [requiredRole];
  if (!allowedRoles.includes(user?.role)) {
    return <Navigate to="/unauthorized" replace />;
  }
}
```

## Features

### Multi-Role Support
- Routes can now accept an array of allowed roles
- Example: `requiredRole={["clinic_admin", "doctor", "receptionist"]}`

### Backward Compatibility
- Existing single-role routes continue to work unchanged
- Example: `requiredRole="clinic_admin"`

### Flexible Access Control
- Enables shared functionality between different user types
- Maintains security by explicitly checking role membership

## Usage Examples

### Single Role (Existing Pattern)
```jsx
<ProtectedRoute requiredRole="clinic_admin">
  <AdminDashboard />
</ProtectedRoute>
```

### Multiple Roles (New Pattern)
```jsx
<ProtectedRoute requiredRole={["clinic_admin", "doctor", "receptionist"]}>
  <ReportsDashboard />
</ProtectedRoute>
```

### No Role Requirement (Any Authenticated User)
```jsx
<ProtectedRoute>
  <ProfilePage />
</ProtectedRoute>
```

## Current Usage in Application

### Reports System
The reports routes now use multi-role access:
- `/reports` - Accessible to admin, doctor, and receptionist
- `/reports/:reportType` - Accessible to admin, doctor, and receptionist

Role-based data filtering is handled at the API level, ensuring users only see appropriate data.

## Benefits

1. **Flexibility**: Routes can serve multiple user types without duplication
2. **Maintainability**: Single route definition for shared functionality
3. **Security**: Explicit role checking prevents unauthorized access
4. **Compatibility**: No breaking changes to existing routes

## Documentation Updates

The following documentation files have been updated to reflect this enhancement:
- `README.md` - Updated component architecture and security sections
- `PATIENT-FORM-README.md` - Updated security features section
- `FRONTEND-AUTH-FIX.md` - Updated to reflect current implementation

## Testing

The enhancement maintains all existing security guarantees:
- Authentication is still required for all protected routes
- Users must have appropriate roles to access routes
- Unauthorized users are properly redirected
- Single-role routes continue to work as expected
