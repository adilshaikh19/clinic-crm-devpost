# Frontend Authorization Enhancement

## Multi-Role Support Implementation
The `ProtectedRoute` component has been enhanced to support both single-role and multi-role access control, providing flexible route protection for the application.

## Background
Originally, the `ProtectedRoute` component was designed to handle only a single role string, but the application needed support for routes accessible to multiple user roles simultaneously:

```javascript
// App.js - Reports routes configuration
<ProtectedRoute requiredRole={["clinic_admin", "doctor", "receptionist"]}>
```

```javascript
// ProtectedRoute.js - Original logic (BROKEN)
if (requiredRole && user?.role !== requiredRole) {
  return <Navigate to="/unauthorized" replace />;
}
```

**Problem**: `user?.role !== requiredRole` was comparing a string to an array, which always returned `true`, causing unauthorized redirects.

## Current Implementation

### Enhanced ProtectedRoute Component ✅
**File**: `frontend/src/components/shared/ProtectedRoute.js`

**Before**:
```javascript
if (requiredRole && user?.role !== requiredRole) {
  return <Navigate to="/unauthorized" replace />;
}
```

**After**:
```javascript
// Handle both single role string and array of roles
if (requiredRole) {
  const allowedRoles = Array.isArray(requiredRole) ? requiredRole : [requiredRole];
  if (!allowedRoles.includes(user?.role)) {
    return <Navigate to="/unauthorized" replace />;
  }
}
```

### How It Works Now ✅

1. **Array Detection**: Checks if `requiredRole` is an array or single string
2. **Normalization**: Converts single strings to arrays for consistent handling
3. **Role Checking**: Uses `includes()` to check if user's role is in allowed roles
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Still works with existing single-role routes

## Impact

### Fixed Routes ✅
- **Reports Dashboard**: `/reports` - Now accessible to admin, doctor, receptionist
- **Individual Reports**: `/reports/:reportType` - Now accessible to admin, doctor, receptionist

### Maintained Security ✅
- **Single Role Routes**: Still work correctly (admin-only, doctor-only, etc.)
- **Authentication**: Login requirement still enforced
- **Role Validation**: Proper role checking maintained

### User Experience ✅
- **Admin Users**: Can now access reports without unauthorized errors
- **Doctor Users**: Can access reports with their filtered data
- **Receptionist Users**: Can access reports with clinic-wide data
- **Unauthorized Users**: Still properly redirected to unauthorized page

## Testing Verification

### Test Cases ✅
1. **Admin Login → Reports**: Should work without redirect
2. **Doctor Login → Reports**: Should work with filtered data
3. **Receptionist Login → Reports**: Should work with clinic data
4. **Invalid Role → Reports**: Should redirect to unauthorized
5. **No Login → Reports**: Should redirect to login

### Route Types Supported ✅
- **Single Role**: `requiredRole="clinic_admin"`
- **Multiple Roles**: `requiredRole={["clinic_admin", "doctor"]}`
- **No Role**: `requiredRole={undefined}` (any authenticated user)

## Files Modified

### Frontend:
- ✅ `frontend/src/components/shared/ProtectedRoute.js` - Enhanced role checking logic

### No Backend Changes:
- Backend authorization was already working correctly
- Issue was purely frontend route protection logic

## Expected Results

After this fix:
1. **Admin users** should access reports dashboard without unauthorized redirects
2. **All authorized roles** should access their appropriate report data
3. **Existing single-role routes** should continue working normally
4. **Unauthorized access attempts** should still be properly blocked

## Security Notes

### Enhanced Security ✅
- **Flexible Role Checking**: Supports both single and multiple role requirements
- **Proper Validation**: Ensures user role is explicitly in allowed roles list
- **Fail-Safe Design**: Defaults to blocking access if role check fails

### Maintained Protection ✅
- **Authentication Required**: Users must still be logged in
- **Role Enforcement**: Users must have appropriate roles
- **Route Protection**: Unauthorized routes still redirect properly

The frontend authorization system now correctly handles both single-role and multi-role route protection, allowing admins and other authorized users to access reports while maintaining security.
