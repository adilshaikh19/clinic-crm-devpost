## Database Schema

### User Model
```javascript
{
  clinicId: String,           // Multi-tenant isolation
  name: String,               // User's full name
  email: String,              // Unique within clinic
  passwordHash: String,       // bcrypt hashed password
  role: String,               // clinic_admin, doctor, receptionist
  phone: String,              // Optional phone number
  specialization: String,     // For doctors only
  isActive: Boolean,          // User status (default: true)
  createdAt: Date,            // Auto-generated
  updatedAt: Date             // Auto-updated
}
```

### Activity Log Model
```javascript
{
  clinicId: String,           // Multi-tenant isolation
  userId: ObjectId,           // User who performed action
  action: String,             // create, update, delete, login, logout
  entityType: String,         // user, patient, appointment, etc.
  entityId: String,           // ID of affected entity
  description: String,        // Human-readable description
  details: Object,            // Additional metadata
  ipAddress: String,          // Optional IP tracking
  userAgent: String,          // Optional browser info
  createdAt: Date             // Auto-generated timestamp
}
```

## Testing

### Backend Testing
```bash
# Test user management functionality
node test-user.js

# Test authentication
node test-login.js
```

### Frontend Testing
1. Login as admin user
2. Navigate to `/admin/users`
3. Test creating, editing, and managing users
4. Verify role-based access controls
5. Test user activation/deactivation

## Performance Optimizations

### Database Indexing
- Compound indexes for clinic isolation
- Email uniqueness indexes within clinics
- Optimized queries for user lookups

### API Efficiency
- Selective field projection (exclude password hashes)
- Efficient aggregation pipelines for statistics
- Proper error handling and validation

### Frontend Optimization
- Efficient state management with React Context
- Optimized re-renders with proper dependencies
- Loading states for better user experience

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection
- Password hashes never returned in API responses
- Clinic data isolation enforced at all levels
- Input sanitization and validation

### Access Control
- JWT token validation on all protected routes
- Role-based permissions enforced
- Admin account protections

### Audit Trail
- Complete activity logging for compliance
- User action tracking for security monitoring
- Detailed operation history
